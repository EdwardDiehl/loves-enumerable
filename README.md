# Enumerable: How I fell in love with Ruby

This repository contains code snippets used in my presentation on Ruby's enumerable module. Ruby code was written to run on Ruby 2.2.

[Enumerable presentation on Slidedeck](https://speakerdeck.com/rossta/enumerable-how-i-fell-in-love-with-ruby)


## Usage

To run a sample, clone the repo and install the gems:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rossta/loves-enumerable.git
$ gem install
```

Then simply run the code with the ruby executable.

```bash
$ ruby code/pascals_triangle.rb
```

You'll get the most out of this repo by inspecting the source along with following the presentation.

## Main Points

Use more of the Enumerable API
- look for more direct solutions
- read the docs

Learn how Enumerable methods are implemented
- itâ€™s not magic
- implement Enumerable on your own
- create your own extensions

Encapsulate complexity of enumerating
- e.g. stream data to client,
- deferred data fetching

Provide Enumerators
- for any method that returns an enumerable with a block:
  return an enumerator when the block is missing

When to be Lazy
- for avoiding eager evaluation
- for filtering results over large collection

Embrace the functional flavor
- given the same inputs, you can expect the same results
- use Enumerables like Legos: as building blocks
